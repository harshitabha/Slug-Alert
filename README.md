# Slug Alert
## Inspiration
We were especially inspired by the health and student welfare side of this project. We wanted to make sure students felt safe on campus, and saw this as an issue pertaining to that, which needed to be fixed.
## What it does
It's an alert system that students can use to call for help if they are in a secluded or far away spot from where someone would usually be able to find and help them. Based on the responders idea we had in mind, it would make it much more likely someone in the woods would get help if they were in a dangerous situation.
## How we built it
We used Svelte for the front end of the web app, which actually caused most of our problems and really hindered a lot of our work. We had a backend of Firebase and also used Google Maps API throughout to implement some different side features.
## Challenges we ran into
The only main challenge we ran into was Svelte. We didn't realize it when we started but Svelte is a React Native alternative that lets you create web apps. Unfortunately Svelte is built for single page web apps, but not built for it very well, and ended up breaking most of our stuff causing us to restructure our entire project about 8 hours before the deadline.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're all very proud that we actually have something to present after the terrible chaos that was Svelte. Specifically we're proud of the safety feature built into the button requiring the user to hold it to make a call, the functional map service that gives time, distance and directions for responders to get to those in need, and the backend firebase that is fully functional
## What we learned
The main thing we learned was to do research on the tools you'll be using before you use them, as we learned the hard way that they can be very problematic and possibly project-destroying to not do so.
## What's next for Slug Alert
We're still very happy with our idea and think it could work really well for UCSC students despite our issues with implementation. So we might consider switching to React Native and restarting if we were to continue working on this project
